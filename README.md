# Real time web
## Concept
My project is going to be a chat app that includes diffrent rooms.
One of these rooms is going to be a room about movies/actors/famous quotes from movies etc.
The app will send some random movie related content to the chat and users have to guess what movie those things belong to.
The user with the fastest (correct) response wins that round.
